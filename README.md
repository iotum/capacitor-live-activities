## How updates work — app-driven vs push-driven

There are two ways to keep a Live Activity in sync. **You can use either or both.**

### App-driven (default — no Firebase, no APNs setup)

Your app calls `LiveActivities.update()` directly, for example from a WebSocket handler or a background fetch. Works on all supported OS versions with zero extra setup.

```
Your app  ──update()──▶  Native layer  ──▶  Live Activity UI
```

### Push-driven (server sends updates while app is closed)

Your server pushes a payload directly to the device. The OS updates the Live Activity UI even if your app is not running.

```
Your server  ──POST──▶  APNs / FCM  ──▶  Live Activity UI
```

| | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol | APNs `liveActivity` push type | FCM data message |
| Firebase needed? | ❌ No — direct APNs | ✅ Yes (optional peer dep) |
| Token source | `getPushToken({ activityId })` | `getPushToken({ activityId })` |

---

## Requirements

| Tool | Minimum version |
|---|---|
| Capacitor | 8.0 |
| iOS deployment target | 13.0 (Live Activities activate at runtime on 16.2+) |
| Android `minSdkVersion` | 23 |
| Android `compileSdkVersion` | 35+ |
| Java | 21 |
| Node | 18+ |

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ciabosoftwaresolutions/capacitor-live-activities
npx cap sync
```

---

## iOS setup

### Native token postbacks

On iOS, configure token uploads after login using the absolute HTTPS URL of
your app server's token endpoint (not a relative URL or an `app://` URL):

```typescript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
import { LiveActivities } from '@ciabosoftwaresolutions/capacitor-live-activities';

if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios') {
  await LiveActivities.configureTokenUpload({
    url: `${appServerBaseURL}/live_activity_tokens`,
    origin: window.location.origin,
  });
}
```

The URL and origin persist across launches. Registration also uploads currently
cached tokens. Call `await LiveActivities.resetTokenUpload()` before logout or
switching accounts/servers; it clears configuration and cancels pending uploads.
No cookies or tokens are stored in the configuration.

The destination must use HTTPS and match the Capacitor `server.hostname` or
`server.url` host. For another app server host, supply an explicit native allowlist
in Capacitor config (this replaces the default host list):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "LiveActivities": {
      "tokenUploadAllowedHosts": ["api.example.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

Allowlist entries can also use `*.example.com` to trust subdomains of that domain.
This does not match the root domain or lookalike domains; include `example.com`
separately when needed. HTTPS remains required for every upload.

The origin must exactly match the configured WebView origin. `configureTokenUpload`
rejects on iOS < 16.2, a missing `url`/`origin`, a non-HTTPS or disallowed host,
URL credentials/fragment, or an origin mismatch.

#### When POSTs are sent

- On `configureTokenUpload` (for cached activity tokens of `active`/`stale`
  activities, and the cached push-to-start token).
- When an activity is adopted at launch or started (if its token is known).
- Whenever iOS issues or rotates an activity or push-to-start token.

The same token is therefore POSTed repeatedly (every launch, every
configure call). Tokens are not queued while unconfigured, and failed uploads
are not persisted; they are retried only on the next trigger above.

#### Request format

| Request | Body |
|---|---|
| `POST` activity token | `{"kind": "activity", "token", "activity_id", "activity_type"}` |
| `POST` push-to-start token | `{"kind": "push_to_start", "token"}` |
| `DELETE` activity token | `{"activity_id"}` |

All requests go to the configured URL with JSON bodies and the headers
`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`, `Origin` and
`Cookie`. Tokens are lowercase hex. Native requests need no CORS.

- **Auth:** cookies are read fresh from the default `WKWebsiteDataStore`,
  filtered by host, path and expiry, and forwarded as-is. The app must keep
  the WebView session valid; the server authenticates and rejects (e.g. 401)
  requests without a session.
- **Delivery:** five-second timeout per attempt; up to two retries on network
  errors with one/two-second backoff. Redirects are not followed. HTTP errors
  are not retried. Any 2xx counts as success; the response body is ignored.
- **Background:** each request runs in a background task. It is skipped if
  iOS grants no background time and cancelled when the time expires.

#### DELETE

When a tracked activity ends (via `end()` or an `ended`/`dismissed` state,
including push-driven ends), the plugin sends one DELETE with the same auth,
headers and delivery rules.

#### Server and app considerations

- **Make POST an upsert.** Key activity tokens by `activity_id` (replacing a
  rotated token) and push-to-start tokens by session/user; repeats are normal.
- **Make DELETE idempotent.** If the app also removes tokens from JS (for
  example on `activityStateChanged`), the server receives duplicate DELETEs
  while the WebView is alive. Either accept repeats without error or drop the
  JS removal.
- **Requests are not ordered.** A retried POST can arrive after the DELETE
  for the same activity. Ignore or expire tokens for activities the server
  already considers ended.
- **Don't delete on `stale`.** A stale activity still accepts push updates;
  the native side only deletes on `ended`/`dismissed`. Mirror that in any JS
  cleanup.
- **CSRF.** Native requests send no CSRF token header. The server must accept
  the `Origin` header (plus session cookie) for both POST and DELETE.
- **No DELETE without a running process.** If an activity ends while the app
  is terminated and iOS does not relaunch it, no DELETE is sent. Treat APNs
  errors (e.g. `410`/invalid token) and token age as the final cleanup path.

#### Startup

For background launches, import the plugin module in AppDelegate and call
the startup API at the beginning of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, before
creating/loading the bridge or WebView:

```swift
import CiabosoftwaresolutionsCapacitorLiveActivities

// In application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:):
LiveActivitiesPlugin.startNativeObservers()
```

The plugin's `load()` remains an idempotent fallback. Existing JS events and
getters are unchanged; events emitted before JS listeners exist are not replayed.
Android has no native token postback implementation; guard calls by platform.

Verify on a physical device running iOS 17.2+: log in and register the postback,
background/lock the device, trigger push-to-start, and confirm an authenticated
POST before opening the app. Then send update/end pushes. Test termination
separately: background tasks extend execution but cannot force iOS to launch
the process. Logs use `LiveActivities:` and never include full tokens/cookies.

> **Device requirement** — Live Activities and the Dynamic Island render on physical devices only. The Lock Screen banner is visible in the iOS 16.2+ Simulator but the Dynamic Island is not. Always test the full experience on a real device.

---

### Compatibility — iOS 13+ compiles, iOS 16.2+ activates

The plugin and Widget Extension template both use `#if canImport(ActivityKit)` and `@available(iOS 16.2, *)` guards throughout, so **they compile against any deployment target from iOS 13 upwards**. No code changes are needed in your project.

At runtime the behaviour is:

| iOS version | `isSupported()` | `start()` / `update()` / `end()` |
|---|---|---|
| iOS 16.2+ | `true` | Works normally |
| iOS 13 – 16.1 | `false` | Rejects with a clear error message |

Always check `isSupported()` before calling `start()` and branch accordingly in your app logic.

```typescript
const { supported } = await LiveActivities.isSupported();
if (supported) {
  const { activityId } = await LiveActivities.start({ ... });
} else {
  // Fall back to a regular notification, badge, or nothing
}
```

---

### Step 1 — Minimum deployment target (optional adjustment)

The plugin works with whatever deployment target your project already has. If you **want** to raise it to iOS 16.2 to remove the availability checks from your own Swift/Capacitor code, set it in Xcode → select target → **General** → **Minimum Deployments** → `iOS 16.2`. This is entirely optional.

---

### Step 2 — Enable capabilities on the main app target

In Xcode → select your **main app target** → **Signing & Capabilities**:

1. Click **+ Capability** → add **Live Activities** (this also adds WidgetKit automatically).
2. Click **+ Capability** → add **Push Notifications** *(required even for app-driven updates — the OS needs this entitlement to issue APNs activity tokens)*.
3. Click **+ Capability** → add **Background Modes** → check **Remote notifications** *(allows the app to receive push-driven updates while in the background)*.

---

### Step 3 — Update Info.plist

Add these keys to your main app's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<!-- Required: opt the app in to Live Activities -->
<key>NSSupportsLiveActivities</key>
<true/>

<!-- Optional but recommended: allow updates more than once per hour.
     Without this key iOS throttles updates aggressively. -->
<key>NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates</key>
<true/>
```

---

### Step 4 — Add a Widget Extension target

The Live Activity UI (Lock Screen banner + Dynamic Island) runs inside a separate Widget Extension mini-app that Apple's system spawns independently.

1. **File → New → Target → Widget Extension** — name it e.g. `LiveActivityWidget`.
2. When prompted, **uncheck** *"Include Configuration App Intent"* and **check** *"Include Live Activity"*.
3. Xcode creates the extension with a new bundle ID — by convention use `<your-main-bundle-id>.LiveActivityWidget` (e.g. `com.yourcompany.yourapp.LiveActivityWidget`). Verify this under the extension target → **General → Bundle Identifier**.
4. Set the extension's **Minimum Deployments** to `iOS 16.2` (same as Step 1).
5. Replace the generated Swift file with the ready-made template from this repo:
   ```
   example/ios/LiveActivityWidget/LiveActivityWidget.swift
   ```
6. Add `LiveActivityManager.swift` (from `ios/Plugin/` in this repo) to **both** the main app target **and** the Widget Extension target. This is what lets the extension read the same `LiveActivityAttributes` type that the plugin writes.
   - Select `LiveActivityManager.swift` in the Xcode file navigator.
   - Open the **File Inspector** (right panel).
   - Under **Target Membership** check both your main app target and `LiveActivityWidget`.

---

### Step 5 — Add a shared App Group

An App Group lets the main app and the widget extension share data across the process boundary.

1. Select your **main app target** → **Signing & Capabilities** → **+ Capability** → **App Groups**.
2. Click **+** and add a group: `group.com.yourcompany.yourapp`
3. Select the **LiveActivityWidget target** → repeat the same steps with the **exact same** group identifier.

> Xcode generates a `.entitlements` file for each target automatically when you add a capability. If you already have an entitlements file, the capability is merged into it.

---

### Step 6 — Register the plugin (Capacitor 6)

The plugin auto-registers via `@CapacitorPlugin` — no manual Swift code needed. Just run:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

---

### Step 7 — APNs key (push-driven updates only)

Skip this step if you are only using app-driven updates.

To send server-side Live Activity updates via APNs you need an **APNs Auth Key** (`.p8` file) — this is a single key that works for all your apps, unlike the older certificate-based approach.

1. Go to [Apple Developer → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list).
2. Click **+** → name it (e.g. `APNs Auth Key`) → check **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)** → **Continue → Register → Download**.
3. Save the `.p8` file securely — you can only download it once.
4. Note your:
   - **Key ID** (shown on the key detail page, 10-character string)
   - **Team ID** (top-right of the developer portal, also 10 characters)
   - **Bundle ID** of your app

Your server uses these three values plus the `.p8` file to sign JWT tokens for APNs requests. See the [Push-driven updates — iOS](#ios--apns-no-firebase-required) section below for the payload format.

---

## Android setup

### 1. Request notification permission at runtime (Android 13+)

```typescript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'android') {
  // Use your preferred permission library or the Capacitor Permissions API
  await Notification.requestPermission();
}
```

### 2. compileSdkVersion

To use the Android 16 Live Updates chip (`FLAG_LIVE_UPDATE`), set `compileSdkVersion = 36` in your app's `android/variables.gradle`. The plugin falls back to a standard sticky notification automatically on older versions.

---

## Usage

```typescript
import { LiveActivities } from '@ciabosoftwaresolutions/capacitor-live-activities';

// Check support
const { supported } = await LiveActivities.isSupported();
const { enabled }   = await LiveActivities.areActivitiesEnabled();

// Start
const { activityId } = await LiveActivities.start({
  attributes: {
    activityType: 'order-tracking',   // identifies the activity kind
    orderId: '12345',                 // static: never changes during the activity
  },
  state: {
    title: 'Order on its way',        // required
    subtitle: '3 stops away',
    progress: 0.6,                    // 0.0 – 1.0
    icon: 'shippingbox.fill',         // SF Symbol (iOS) / drawable name (Android)
  },
  staleAfterSeconds: 3600,            // iOS only
});

// Update (app-driven)
// ⚠️ update() REPLACES the entire state — re-send every field you want to keep
// (icon, colors, etc.), not just the ones that changed. See the callout below.
await LiveActivities.update({
  activityId,
  state: {
    title: 'Order arriving now',
    subtitle: 'Next stop',
    progress: 0.95,
    icon: 'shippingbox.fill',   // re-send, or it disappears
  },
  alertTitle: 'Your order is almost here!',   // iOS: shows a banner
  alertBody: '1 stop away',
});

// End
await LiveActivities.end({
  activityId,
  finalState: {
    title: 'Delivered!',
    subtitle: 'Enjoy your order',
    progress: 1.0,
    icon: 'checkmark.circle.fill',
  },
  dismissalPolicy: 'after-delay',   // iOS only; leaves it visible briefly
});

// Get active activities
const { activities } = await LiveActivities.getActiveActivities();

// Listen for system-driven state changes (iOS only)
await LiveActivities.addListener('activityStateChanged', (event) => {
  console.log(event.activityId, event.activityState); // 'active' | 'ended' | 'dismissed'
});
```

> ### ⚠️ `update()` and `end()` replace the **entire** state
>
> Live Activities are stateless between updates — each `update()` (and `end()`'s
> `finalState`) **fully replaces** the previous content state. Any field you omit
> reverts to its default: a missing `icon` disappears, missing `progressColor`
> falls back to white, a missing `subtitle` vanishes.
>
> **Always re-send every field you want to keep**, not just the ones that changed:
>
> ```typescript
> // Keep one source of truth for the visual style, then spread it on every call
> const style = {
>   icon: 'shippingbox.fill',
>   backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e',
>   progressColor: '#4ade80',
>   textColor: '#ffffff',
> };
>
> await LiveActivities.start({ attributes, state: { title: 'Order placed', progress: 0, ...style } });
> await LiveActivities.update({ activityId, state: { title: 'On the way', progress: 0.6, ...style } });
> await LiveActivities.end({ activityId, finalState: { title: 'Delivered', progress: 1, ...style } });
> ```

---

## Push-driven updates

### iOS — APNs (no Firebase required)

Call `getPushToken()` right after `start()` and send the token to your server. The token is specific to each activity instance and may rotate — always use the latest one from the `pushTokenUpdated` event.

```typescript
// Get token immediately after start
const { token, type } = await LiveActivities.getPushToken({ activityId });
// type === 'apns'
await yourServer.registerActivityToken({ activityId, token });

// Re-register whenever the token rotates (iOS may reissue it)
await LiveActivities.addListener('pushTokenUpdated', async (event) => {
  await yourServer.registerActivityToken({
    activityId: event.activityId,
    token: event.token,  // always use the freshest token
  });
});
```

**Server payload** — send a `POST` to `https://api.push.apple.com/3/device/<token>` with:

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "timestamp": 1700000000,
    "event": "update",
    "content-state": {
      "title": "Order arriving now",
      "subtitle": "1 stop away",
      "progress": 0.95
    },
    "alert": {
      "title": "Order update",
      "body": "Your order is almost here!"
    }
  }
}
```

The `content-state` keys map directly to `LiveActivityState` fields. Use `"event": "end"` to end the activity from the server.

> **APNs push type must be** `liveactivity` and the `:path` header must be `/3/device/<activityPushToken>` (not the regular device token).

#### ⚠️ Caveat — don't use `timerEnd` / `timerStart` over push

Those two fields map to Swift `Date`. When ActivityKit decodes a pushed `content-state`, it uses `Codable`'s default date strategy — **seconds since 2001-01-01**, *not* Unix epoch. So a Unix timestamp sent from your server lands ~31 years off.

For **push-driven** timers, send a numeric `progress` (0–1) and a text subtitle (e.g. `"Arriving by 8:45 PM"`) instead, and recompute on the server with each push. App-driven timers (set on-device via `start()`/`update()`) are unaffected — use `timerEnd` freely there.

---

### iOS — push-to-start (launch activities from the server, iOS 17.2+)

`getPushToken()` requires the activity to already be running on-device. To **start** a Live Activity entirely from your server — perfect for order tracking or appointment reminders where the app may be closed — use the **push-to-start token** instead.

```typescript
import { LiveActivities } from '@ciabosoftwaresolutions/capacitor-live-activities';

// The token is type-level (not per-activity). Register it once at launch and
// whenever it rotates. Send it to your server keyed by user/device.
await LiveActivities.addListener('pushToStartTokenUpdated', async (event) => {
  await yourServer.registerPushToStartToken({ token: event.token });
});

// Optional: read the current value (may be null until the system issues it)
const { token } = await LiveActivities.getPushToStartToken();
```

**Server payload to start an activity** — `POST https://api.push.apple.com/3/device/<push-to-start-token>`:

```
apns-topic       <your.bundle.id>.push-type.liveactivity
apns-push-type   liveactivity
```
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "timestamp": 1700000000,
    "event": "start",
    "attributes-type": "LiveActivityAttributes",
    "attributes": { "activityType": "order-tracking" },
    "content-state": {
      "title": "Order received",
      "subtitle": "Preparing your food",
      "progress": 0.1,
      "icon": "fork.knife"
    },
    "alert": { "title": "Order received", "body": "We're preparing your food" }
  }
}
```

After the activity starts, the device fires `pushTokenUpdated` with that activity's **per-activity** token — store it to send subsequent `update` / `end` pushes.

> Push-to-start is **iOS 17.2+** only. On older iOS and Android, `getPushToStartToken()` returns `{ token: null }` — fall back to starting the activity in-app.

---

### Sending from a Java backend

Both the per-activity and push-to-start flows are plain APNs HTTP/2 requests. The cleanest Java option is [**Pushy**](https://github.com/jchambers/pushy) (`com.eatthepath:pushy`), which has first-class Live Activity support.

```java
// One-time client, signed with your APNs Auth Key (.p8)
ApnsClient client = new ApnsClientBuilder()
    .setApnsServer(ApnsClientBuilder.PRODUCTION_APNS_HOST)
    .setSigningKey(ApnsSigningKey.loadFromPkcs8File(
        new File("AuthKey_ABC123.p8"), "YOUR_TEAM_ID", "YOUR_KEY_ID"))
    .build();

// Build the content-state — keys MUST match LiveActivityState fields
String payload = new SimpleApnsPayloadBuilder()
    .setContentState(Map.of(
        "title", "Order arriving now",
        "subtitle", "1 stop away",
        "progress", 0.95,
        "progressColor", "#4ade80"))
    .setEvent("update")                      // "start" | "update" | "end"
    .setTimestamp(Instant.now().getEpochSecond())
    .build();

// topic = <bundleId>.push-type.liveactivity, push type = LIVE_ACTIVITY
var push = new SimpleApnsPushNotification(
    token,                                   // per-activity OR push-to-start token
    "com.yourcompany.yourapp.push-type.liveactivity",
    payload,
    null,
    DeliveryPriority.IMMEDIATE,
    PushType.LIVE_ACTIVITY);

client.sendNotification(push).get();
```

For a **`start`** push, also include the `attributes-type` and `attributes` in the content-state builder (Pushy exposes `setEvent("start")` plus raw map fields) and send to the **push-to-start** token.

**Token bookkeeping your backend needs:**

| Token | From | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Push-to-start | `pushToStartTokenUpdated` | `event: "start"` — launch new activities |
| Per-activity | `pushTokenUpdated` (after start) | `event: "update"` / `"end"` for that activity |

---

### Android — FCM (optional)

Firebase is **not** a hard dependency. The plugin uses reflection to detect Firebase at runtime — if it isn't in the project `getPushToken()` returns `null` cleanly and everything else still works.

#### Add Firebase to your project (opt-in)

1. Follow the [Firebase Android setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) to add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`.

2. In `android/build.gradle` (project level):
   ```gradle
   classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.2'
   ```

3. In `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:24.1.0'
   ```

4. Run `npx cap sync`.

#### Get the FCM token

```typescript
// activityId is ignored on Android — FCM tokens are per-device, not per-activity
const { token, type } = await LiveActivities.getPushToken({ activityId });
// type === 'fcm' when Firebase is present, null otherwise
if (token) {
  await yourServer.registerFcmToken({ token });
}
```

#### Server payload

Send a FCM **data message** (not a notification message) so the OS delivers it even when the app is in the background:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "token": "<fcm-device-token>",
    "data": {
      "liveActivityId": "your-activity-id",
      "title": "Order arriving now",
      "subtitle": "1 stop away",
      "progress": "0.95"
    }
  }
}
```

Your app should handle the incoming FCM data message (via a Firebase `onMessageReceived` service) and call `LiveActivities.update()` with the new state.

> On Android the OS does not update the notification directly from the push payload — FCM wakes your app, your app calls `update()`. This is by design and means your update logic stays in one place (TypeScript).

## Customising the iOS Widget UI

### Structured display data

Copy `ios/Widget/LiveActivityWidget.swift` into the host app's Widget Extension,
replacing its generated widget and widget bundle. Include
`ios/Plugin/LiveActivityAttributes.swift` in both targets. The plugin alone cannot
install a widget extension. Rebuild and install the app to enable this layout.

The optional `display` contract is domain-independent. Send labels and formatted
values, not CRM-specific rendering instructions. Item and section ids must be
stable across updates; array order determines display priority.

```json
{
  "title": "Jane Example",
  "subtitle": "Example Industries",
  "icon": "phone.fill",
  "display": {
    "version": 1,
    "url": "https://app.example.com/app/call/example",
    "sections": [
      { "id": "matches", "title": "Matches", "items": [
        { "id": "hubspot", "label": "Jane Example", "badge": "HS", "selected": true },
        { "id": "connectwise", "label": "Jane Example", "badge": "CW" }
      ] },
      { "id": "metrics", "title": "Metrics", "items": [
        { "id": "open_tickets", "label": "Open tickets", "value": "3" },
        { "id": "account_tier", "label": "Account", "value": "Gold" }
      ] }
    ],
    "actions": [
      { "id": "create_ticket", "label": "New ticket", "icon": "plus", "url": "https://app.example.com/app/call/example?action=create_ticket" }
    ]
  }
}
```

For APNs, put `display` directly inside `aps.content-state`, not inside `extras`.
App-driven `start` and `update` accept the same object inside `state`. Old states
without `display` still decode. Always send the complete state, including both
`sections` and `actions` (use empty arrays when absent).

The template shows at most two sections, six pills on the Lock Screen (fewer
when space is tight), four in the expanded Dynamic Island, and two action links.
Remaining items open in the app through `display.url`; send all ordered items
only when the complete ActivityKit payload fits its 4 KB budget. Compact/minimal
presentations show an icon and status/timer, not pills. `display.status` overrides
the timer, for example `Ended · 02:34` supplied by the server. Links accept HTTP(S);
configure universal links in the host app for in-app routing. Missing-value pills
can use their source `display` string verbatim, including an em dash.

The app server can map matches to `{id, label: displayName, badge: crm.monogram, selected}`
and metrics to `{id: key, label, value: display}`. It should keep customer order,
preserve stable ids, and replace the complete display on each context update.

This template currently targets iPhone Lock Screen and Dynamic Island. Apple
Watch layouts and Android structured-display rendering are not included.

The default widget renders **icon · title · subtitle · progress bar** using a dark frosted background. To customise it:

1. Open `LiveActivityWidget.swift` in your Widget Extension target.
2. Edit `LockScreenView` (Lock Screen / banner) and the `DynamicIsland` regions.
3. Add extra fields to `LiveActivityAttributes.ContentState` — they flow through automatically in the `extras` dictionary.

### Built-in colors & sizing — no Swift needed

You can restyle the default widget entirely from JavaScript by passing these `state` fields. All are optional and iOS-only (Android ignores them gracefully):

```typescript
await LiveActivities.start({
  attributes: { activityType: 'order' },
  state: {
    title: 'Pizza on the way',
    subtitle: 'Arriving in',
    icon: 'fork.knife',
    timerEnd: Date.now() / 1000 + 150,

    // 🎨 Colors — hex string (#RGB, #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA), with or without leading "#"
    backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e',   // Lock Screen + expanded island background
    progressColor:   '#4ade80',   // progress bar / ring / timer bar
    textColor:       '#ffffff',   // title, subtitle, countdown text
    iconColor:       '#4ade80',   // SF Symbol tint
    keylineTint:     '#4ade80',   // colored glow around the expanded island

    // 📏 Progress bar sizing
    progressBarHeight: 8,         // points, 2–20 (default ~4)
    progressBarRadius: 4,         // points (default: pill / half the height)
  },
});
```

| Field | Affects | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `backgroundColor` | Lock Screen banner + expanded Dynamic Island background | dark translucent |
| `progressColor` | Progress bar, ring, and timer bar fill | white |
| `textColor` | Title, subtitle, countdown text | white |
| `iconColor` | SF Symbol icon tint | white |
| `keylineTint` | The colored outline that wraps the **expanded** Dynamic Island | none |
| `progressBarHeight` | Linear progress bar thickness (points, 2–20) | system (~4) |
| `progressBarRadius` | Linear progress bar corner radius | pill (half the height) |

### About the Dynamic Island "width"

The **physical size of the Dynamic Island is controlled by iOS** — there is no API to force a "full-length" or wider compact island. Apple manages the compact and minimal presentations automatically based on what other activities are running. What you *can* control to make it feel branded and prominent:

- **`keylineTint`** — adds a colored glow border around the **expanded** island (shown on long-press). This is the closest thing to a full-length colored island Apple exposes.
- **`backgroundColor`** — fills the expanded island and Lock Screen banner with your brand color.
- **The expanded layout** — the leading / trailing / center / bottom regions in `LiveActivityWidget.swift` are fully yours to lay out. Add images, multiple rows, buttons (iOS 17+), etc.

The **compact** presentation (the small pill around the camera) is deliberately constrained by iOS to a tiny leading + trailing slot — design for a single glanceable icon + value there.

### configureTokenUpload(...)

```typescript
configureTokenUpload(options: { url: string; origin: string; }) => any
```

iOS only. Persist an HTTPS token postback URL and the exact WebView origin.
Native uploads use fresh WK session cookies, including during background launches.
The host must be allowed by native Capacitor configuration. Call after login.

| Param         | Type                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **`options`** | <code>{ url: string; origin: string; }</code> |

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### resetTokenUpload()

```typescript
resetTokenUpload() => any
```

iOS only. Clear the persisted postback configuration and cancel uploads on logout.

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### isSupported()

```typescript
isSupported() => any
```

Returns true when the current platform and OS version support Live Activities
(iOS 16.2+ with the feature enabled by the user) or Live Updates (Android 16+).
On older Android versions this still returns true because the plugin falls back
to a sticky notification.

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### areActivitiesEnabled()

```typescript
areActivitiesEnabled() => any
```

iOS only — returns true if the user has Live Activities enabled for this app
in Settings. Always true on Android.

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### start(...)

```typescript
start(options: StartOptions) => any
```

Start a new Live Activity / Live Update notification.
Resolves with an `activityId` you must store to call `update()` and `end()`.

| Param         | Type                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **`options`** | <code><a href="#startoptions">StartOptions</a></code> |

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### update(...)

```typescript
update(options: UpdateOptions) => any
```

Push a state update to a running Live Activity.

| Param         | Type                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`options`** | <code><a href="#updateoptions">UpdateOptions</a></code> |

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### end(...)

```typescript
end(options: EndOptions) => any
```

End a Live Activity and optionally show a final state.

| Param         | Type                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **`options`** | <code><a href="#endoptions">EndOptions</a></code> |

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### getActiveActivities()

```typescript
getActiveActivities() => any
```

Returns all currently active activity IDs started by this app.

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### getPushToken(...)

```typescript
getPushToken(options: { activityId: string; }) => any
```

Get the push token for a running Live Activity (iOS) or the FCM device
token (Android).

- **iOS**: pass the `activityId` returned by `start()`. The token is
  specific to that activity and should be sent to your server immediately.
  It may rotate — listen to `pushTokenUpdated` for changes.
- **Android**: `activityId` is ignored. Returns the FCM registration token
  if Firebase is configured in the project, otherwise `null`.

The app-driven update path (`update()`) works without any push token.
You only need this for *server-side* push-driven updates.

| Param         | Type                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **`options`** | <code>{ activityId: string; }</code> |

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### getPushToStartToken()

```typescript
getPushToStartToken() => any
```

iOS 17.2+ only — get the **push-to-start** token. Unlike `getPushToken`,
this token is **not tied to a specific activity** — it lets your server
START a brand-new Live Activity remotely, even if the app has never called
`start()`. Ideal for order tracking, appointment reminders, etc.

Send this token to your server. The system may issue it slightly after
launch, so prefer listening to `pushToStartTokenUpdated` and treat this
getter as a "current value" check.

Returns `{ token: null }` on iOS &lt; 17.2 and on Android.

**Returns:** <code>any</code>

--------------------


### addListener('activityStateChanged' | 'pushTokenUpdated' | 'pushToStartTokenUpdated', ...)

```typescript
addListener(eventName: 'activityStateChanged' | 'pushTokenUpdated' | 'pushToStartTokenUpdated', listenerFunc: (event: ActivityStateChangedEvent | PushTokenUpdatedEvent | PushToStartTokenUpdatedEvent) => void) => any
```

Subscribe to Live Activity events.

- **`activityStateChanged`** — iOS only. Fired when the system changes the
  state of a Live Activity (e.g. the user dismisses it from the Lock Screen).
  Payload: `{ activityId: string, activityState: 'active' | 'ended' | 'dismissed' }`

- **`pushTokenUpdated`** — iOS only. Fired when the per-activity ActivityKit
  push token is first issued or rotated. Re-send it to your server so it can
  continue delivering APNs **updates** to that activity.
  Payload: `{ activityId: string, token: string, type: 'apns' }`

- **`pushToStartTokenUpdated`** — iOS 17.2+ only. Fired when the type-level
  push-to-start token is issued or rotated. Re-send it to your server so it
  can **start** new activities remotely.
  Payload: `{ token: string, type: 'apns' }`

| Param              | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`eventName`**    | <code>'activityStateChanged' \| 'pushTokenUpdated' \| 'pushToStartTokenUpdated'</code>                                                                                                                                                        |

A common way to give the island a branded, "full-length" colored glow. Defaults to no keyline when omitted.                                                                                                                         |

Range 2–20. Defaults to the system thickness (~4) when omitted.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`progressBarRadius`** | <code>number</code>                                                 | iOS only — corner radius in points applied to the linear progress bar when `progressBarHeight` is set. Defaults to half the bar height (pill shape).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

When set, the widget renders a live countdown and an auto-animating progress bar. The system updates the display every second automatically — no `update()` calls needed from JavaScript. Example — start a 2m 30s countdown: ```typescript timerEnd: Date.now() / 1000 + 150 ``` |
| **`timerStart`**        | <code>number</code>                                                 | iOS only — Unix timestamp when the timer started. Used alongside `timerEnd` to compute the progress ring fill. Defaults to `Date.now()` at the moment `start()` is called if omitted.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`timerCountsDown`**   | <code>boolean</code>                                                | iOS only — direction of the timer progress bar/ring. - `true` (default) — bar starts **full** and drains right-to-left as time runs out. - `false` — bar starts **empty** and fills left-to-right as time elapses. The countdown **text** always shows remaining time regardless of this setting.                                                      |

## FAQ — iOS Xcode setup troubleshooting

### "Missing package product 'CapApp-SPM'"

This happens when Xcode loses its reference to the local `CapApp-SPM` package — most commonly after deleting and recreating the `ios/` folder.

**Fix:**
1. In Xcode: **File → Add Package Dependencies → Add Local...**
2. Navigate to `ios/App/CapApp-SPM` and click **Add Package**
3. When prompted for a target, select **none** — `CapApp-SPM` is managed by Capacitor internally
4. Xcode will resolve the package and the error disappears

---

### "Unable to find module dependency: 'Capacitor'" in AppDelegate

After fixing the `CapApp-SPM` reference above, the `Capacitor` module still needs to be linked to the app target.

**Fix:**
- Select your **main app target** → **General** → **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** → **+** → search for **CapApp-SPM** → **Add**

---

### `npx cap sync` keeps re-adding the plugin to `CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`

When you include the plugin's Swift files directly in the Xcode project (recommended for local development), `npx cap sync` will re-add the plugin to `CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` on every run, causing duplicate symbol errors on the next build.

Run this after every `npx cap sync` to clean it out:

```bash
cd example && node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const f = 'ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift';
let c = fs.readFileSync(f, 'utf8');
c = c.replace(/,\s*\.package\(name:.*?capacitor-live-activities.*?\)/s, '');
c = c.replace(/,\s*\.product\(name: \"CiabosoftwaresolutionsCapacitorLiveActivities\".*?\)/s, '');
fs.writeFileSync(f, c);
console.log('Cleaned');
"
```

Or add it as an npm script in your project's `package.json` so you can run `npm run sync:ios` instead:

```json
"scripts": {
  "sync:ios": "npx cap sync ios && node -e \"const fs=require('fs'),f='ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift';let c=fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8');c=c.replace(/,\\s*\\.package\\(name:.*?capacitor-live-activities.*?\\)/s,'');c=c.replace(/,\\s*\\.product\\(name:\\s*\\\"CiabosoftwaresolutionsCapacitorLiveActivities\\\".*?\\)/s,'');fs.writeFileSync(f,c);console.log('CapApp-SPM cleaned');\""
}
```

---

### Plugin not found / "not implemented on ios"

The plugin's Swift files need to be compiled into the app directly. Include them from `node_modules/@ciabosoftwaresolutions/capacitor-live-activities/ios/Plugin/`:

1. Drag `LiveActivitiesPlugin.swift` and `LiveActivityManager.swift` into Xcode
2. ✅ **Copy items if needed**
3. **Target Membership:**
   - `LiveActivityManager.swift` → ✅ main app + ✅ `LiveActivityWidget`
   - `LiveActivitiesPlugin.swift` → ✅ main app only

---

### "Invalid redeclaration of 'LiveActivityWidgetBundle'"

Xcode generates two files when adding a Widget Extension — delete the generated `LiveActivityWidgetBundle.swift`:

Right-click → **Delete → Move to Trash**

---

### "Plugin with id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' not found" (Android)

Add the Kotlin classpath to the plugin's `android/build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()

### Notifications not appearing on Android

Call `requestPermissions()` before `start()` on Android 13+:

const { notifications } = await LiveActivities.requestPermissions();
if (notifications === 'granted') {
  await LiveActivities.start({ ... });
}
```
